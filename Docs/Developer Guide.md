** Sorry, but the content for this page is not yet ready **

| Arrrrrrr. Same old story. Why is the documentation for developers always created last (if at all). We feel your pain. However, there will be a live Power BI Dev camp sessios on Thursday February 24 titled [**Developing External Tools for Power BI Desktop**](https://powerbidevcamp.powerappsportals.com/sessions/session31/). The content for this page is being created together with the content for this upcoming Power BI Dev Camp session. It should be completed by the end of February 2023. Thanks for your patience.
