## **Translations Builder Developer Guide**
> **Sorry, but the content for this page is not yet ready**

Arrrrrrr. Same old story. Why is the documentation for developers always created last (if at all). 

We feel your pain and we have something in the pipeline. There will be a live Power BI Dev camp session on Thursday February 24 titled [**Developing External Tools for Power BI Desktop**](https://powerbidevcamp.powerappsportals.com/sessions/session31/). This Dev Camp session will examine Translations Builder from the perspective of a software developer who wishes to extend its functionality and scope. The content for this page is being created together with the content for this upcoming Power BI Dev Camp session. All this work should be completed by the end of February 2023. 

Thanks for your patience.
